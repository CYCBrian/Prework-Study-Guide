        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) - a programing language used to define how webpage content is presented to users. Defines the colours, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. Basically the language to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a range of style options.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Inline CSS - when a developer styles an element directly inthe HTML file. Applies to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Useful for quick and permanent changes but less flexcible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet - contains CSS rules for the webpage in the heal section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page cose. A single change to the CSS rule in the internal style shee will apply to all tagged page elements in that one page.</li>
          <br>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet - most preferred because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head elelment.</li>
          <br>
          <li>.css - a CSS file.</li>
          <br>
          <li>CSS rule - selector/s (separate each selector with a comma) {property: value; property: value;...} the groups of property and their value is called a Declaration. Everything within the wiggly bracket is a Declaration Block.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Selector - defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Declarations - contain two componenets: the CSS property that is to be applies and the value of the property.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Margin - property that indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Padding - property that adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <br>
          <li>CSS Box Model - every HTML element is a box, consisting of margins outside the element, the element's borders, padding, and the content.</li>
          <br>
          <li>* - used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. Declares that ALL elements on the page will have the describes style properties.</li>
          <br>
          <li>text-align: "text-align type"; - type of positioning property.</li>
          <br>
          <li>img - selector that assigns property values to any image element in the markup</li>
          <br>
          <li>display: block; - the display property is assigned the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Class attribute - Used to add styles to certain elements, but not all elements. Allows the sharing of a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigned the rule to a class attribute with a class selector (."class"). The Class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enable coder to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule. Basically, when coding in the HTML file, you can designate certain block of code as a specific class. Then by using ."class" in the CSS, we can change the style and whatnot of every blocks of code that has the designated class.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) - high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with website. Used to power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, etc. NOTE - the script element should be places just before the closing body tag.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) - built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS style; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating #D graphics and audio samples.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Third-arty APIs - allows developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter and Facebook.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Third-party framworks and libraries - applied to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
          <br>
          <li>.js - file extension that indicates a JavaScript file.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Variable - named container that allows stroage of data in the code.</li>
          <br>
          <li>var - keyword to declare a variable. Then enter unique variable name (e.g. topics). Finally, = to assign the specific data (i.e. the string) to be stored in the variables in "" and end with ; (e.g. var topics = "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript";).</li>
          <br>
          <li>Method - actions that can be performed on objects. A set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Argument - data that is passed into the method's parameters.</li>
          <br>
          <li>console - a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
          <br>
          <li>.log() - method that outputs whatever is added inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Control Flow - the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In javascript, code runs in a top-down manner. Can be controlled or interrupted via Conditional Statements and Loops.</li>
          <br>
          <li>if Statements - a conditional statement. Code will only execute IF the statement meets a condition, or if true (truthy).</li>
          <br>
          <li>Falsy and Truthy - 0, -0, On, "", null, Underfined, NaN, a Boolean data type with the value of "false", are falsy. All other values, as well as Boolean data type with the value of "true", is a truthy.</li>
          <br>
          <li>else if Statements - used where there are more than one conditions. The computer will continue through all of the conditions lisets, evaluating whether or not a condition is truthy. Once it finds a condition that is truthy, it will run the code in the curly brackets associated with that condition, and then break out of the If Statement.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Strict Equality Operator (===) - checks to see if two values are equal, and return a Boolean result (true) if the values are equal and (false) if that values are not equal.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Array - a storage of multiple related values and elements into a single variable. Values can be of any data type; can store a string (must be in quotation marks), number, boolean, and other data types into one variable.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Array Index - unique number corresponding to the location of the data item in the array. Always starts with 0. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <br>
          <li>for loop - uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Must use another statement to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of time. Using the for loop tells the computer to go through each of the data item in our array and log them to the console until there are no data items left. Requires the shape's index and the array's length. Consists of 1- the starting point of the loop, 2- the condition, and 3- statement allowing the array to iterate over each item.</li>
          <br>
          <li>lenght - built-in property of an array. Used as part of the for loop.</li>
          <br>
          <li>var x = 0 - the variable x has a value of 0, indicating that it wants to start at the beginning.</li>
          <br>
          <li>x < shapes.length; - as long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep reunning, allowing the loop to execute one time for each item in the array.</li>
          <br>
          <li>x++ - allows the array to iterate over each item, the x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1</li>
          <br>
          <li>Commenting out code - using /* and then */ around a block of code making it inactive without deleting it, in case it is needed later. The block of code that has been commented out will turn green.</li>
