# Brian's Prework-Study-Guide
## Created as part of the pre-work module for the UofT x edX WebDev bootcamp.

## Description

This is my first ever coding project; a study guide for the pre-work modules of the UofT x edX WebDev Bootcamp.

It contains all the notes I've made while going through the modules and creating this website. Becasue I have a particularly smooth brain, I know I'm going to forgot a lot of the information. This will serve as a reference guide of sorts while I continue with the bootcamp.

The sections include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bash Commands, Git, Deployment, and Other Termanologies.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Simply use the URL to access the website!

Once there, you can review the notes in each section. For a bit of interactivity, open the DevTools (crt+shft+I) and click on the Console tab. There, a randomly generated suggestion will be provided for you as a starting point for your review session.
